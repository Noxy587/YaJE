Yet Another Javascript Editor

Using Backbone combined with Handlebars for this simple editor/paint app.  The idea is tools drawing on a canvas element, as one would
expect from a paint/editor app.

There is currently no functionality as I'm establishing a framework the app will simply produce a toolbar and a blank canvas element at 
this moment.  Hope to have some basic editing available soon!
